Course: COP 5570
Assignment: Project 1
Author: Robert Massicotte


To compile both the "shell" and "myls" programs, simply type "make". 
To run the shell, simply type "./shell".

This shell supports the required built-in commands of "exit", "cd", "pwd", 
and "set", as well as all existing external commands. 

The myls command requires that the MYPATH environment variable be set to 
the location of the myls executable (under the myls directory). If this 
variable is not set, an error message will be printed. If this variable is set 
but does not contain the location of the myls executable, an error message will 
also be printed. When testing on my CS account, I set MYPATH to the value 
"/home/grads/massicot/COP5570/Project1/myls". The program takes an optional 
directory argument. If this argument is not provided, the program will list 
the contents of the current directory.

Multiple pipes are supported. I/O redirection is supported. A simple form of 
background processes is supported, such that the parent process is not blocked 
by the child process, and the next prompt will be printed. All zombie processes 
are reaped by the kernel through the use of signals.

The program does support pipes and I/O redirection in the same command, as 
well as pipes and background process in the same command.

Per the assignment specifications, special characters, like wildcard 
expansion *, are not supported.
